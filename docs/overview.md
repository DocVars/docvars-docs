# Doc Variables Add-on

With **Doc Variables**, you can easily store and manipulate values within your documents, presentations, and spreadsheets. Just declare your variables in the title, body, header, or footer of the doc, and then launch Doc Variables. A form will be generated to allow you and your team members to enter values for the variables. 

This extension allows you to build complex and sophisticated templates and integrations. Great for contracts, invoices, or generating monthly reports or presentations. The Doc Merge function, Salesforce and Hubspot integrations, and other premium features can save you so much time!
